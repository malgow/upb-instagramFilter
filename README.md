# (un)politeBot : Instagram Filter
 my very first instagram filter! a twist on my pre-existing [(un)politeBot browser extension](https://github.com/malgow/upb-browserExtension). <br />

### bts
i enjoyed the simple idea from my previous browser extension project so much that i decided to turn it into a instagram filter. i'm quite happy with it as i'm suprised at how well the idea managed to translate into a filter form.

there is one thing i was upset about during the development of this small project though, i wasn't able to retrieve the phrases online from my database :(. Instagram doesn't allow networking features to be used within filters published to their platform, so i sadly had to scrap that mechanic. the work around for this was to obviously have a pre-defined list of phrases the bot can say, but that just isn't quite as cool.
